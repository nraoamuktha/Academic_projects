# ACADEMIC PROJECTS

- [Roll Call Solution](https://github.com/nraoamuktha/Academic_projects/tree/main/DBMS_Project#rollcall-solution) : RollCall Solutions, developed for the Master's Program Office at Robert H. Smith School of Business, introduces a digital method for attendance and student feedback collection. It replaces paper-based attendance with a digital system where students use access codes. Additionally, it allows immediate feedback collection post-class. The project utilizes data from the UMD Canvas website, Testudo, and the UMD faculty directory. Its database comprises various tables including Departments, Students, and Courses, and collects data for attendance and feedback. The system is rigorously tested and includes SQL queries for business transactions like tracking attendance and analyzing feedback. The solution aims to enhance efficiency and data-driven decision-making in educational settings.
- [Customer Churn Prediction For Retail Store](https://github.com/nraoamuktha/Academic_projects/tree/main/Python_project#customer-acquisition-analysis) : The Customer Acquisition Analysis project provides a detailed study of customer acquisition strategies, presented through an HTML file with interactive visualizations. It focuses on analyzing key metrics like acquisition channels, cost, lifetime value, and conversion rates. The project employs advanced data processing tools (Python, R, SQL), visualization tools (Tableau, PowerBI, D3.js), and statistical analysis to understand customer behavior and segment them based on various factors. This analysis aids in evaluating the return on investment of different marketing strategies. Its applications include enhancing marketing strategy development, gaining deeper customer insights, and identifying opportunities for business growth and customer base expansion.

- [Airbnb Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/nraoamuktha/Academic_projects/tree/main/DataMining#airbnb-data-analysis-and-predictive-modeling): The Airbnb Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling project leverages machine learning to analyze Airbnb listings and predict high booking rates. It involves data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing, alongside extensive feature engineering including text mining and integration of external datasets like population data. Various models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost are implemented and evaluated using metrics like accuracy and AUC-ROC. The project uses numerous R libraries for data processing, modeling, and visualization. Key outcomes include insights into factors affecting booking rates and the selection of the most effective predictive model. It requires CSV files for input and is executed in an R environment.
